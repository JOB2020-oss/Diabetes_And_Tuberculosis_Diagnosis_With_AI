Diabetes_And_Tuberculosis_Diagnosis_With_AI is a project which was built on top of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN),XGBoost and Streamlit which is intended to diagnose the two prominet disease of Diabetes and Tuberculosis.CNN model was trained by using the large collection of MRI chest images from kagle far from that the model architecture involded the VGG block three with 3 Convolusional Layerss.The XGBoost model was also trained from large sample of tabular data which involved features such as Glucose level,Age,Sex as well as body weight to asses whether the person is likely to have diabetes
